7. Which employee made the most sales (by total price)?

SELECT Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName, SUM(Dt_order_total.order_total) as total

LEFT JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID
GROUP BY OrderID) AS Dt_order_total
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Orders.OrderID = Dt_order_total.OrderID
LEFT JOIN Employees ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID
GROUP BY Orders.EmployeeID
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 1
